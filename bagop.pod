=head1 OPTIONS

=over 9

=item B<--dest> I<[[user@]host:][dir]> 

Destination folder. B<--dest> determines where the backup will be
saved. I<dir> is the directory where the backup should be saved
(defaults to . if a remote host is given). I<host> is the name of the
remote host on which the backup is (default: no remote host). I<user>
is the username on the remote host (default: your username).

The syntax is the same as for B<rsync>.

The default is ~/backup/bagop.


=item B<-d>

=item B<--dryrun>

Dry run. Do not do the actual backup but show what would be done.


=item B<-q>

=item B<--quiet>

Quiet. Do not output progress information and warnings. Only report errors.


=item B<add> I<files>

Add to the backup. Mark I<files> for backing up from now on. Adding a
dir will add all files and furture files under that dir.


=item B<del> I<files>

Delete from the backup. Mark I<files> for not being backed up any
more. Does it mean it is deleted from the backup?


=item B<commit>

Do the actual backup. This will copy the files to the backup.


=item B<stat>

=item B<status>

Show status. Show the status of the files.

=back
